    title: "Solar Systems & Solutions - On-Grid, Hybrid & Off-Grid",
    content: `Solar System Solutions by ALP Solar South Punjab:
1. On-Grid Solar Systems (Grid-Tied):
- Connected directly to the MEPCO electrical grid with a bi-directional green meter.
- Daytime solar power powers the property directly, and surplus power is exported to MEPCO for bill credits.
- Highly cost-effective with the shortest payback period (2.5 to 3 years). No batteries required.

2. Hybrid Solar Systems:
- Combines grid connection, solar generation, and Livo Lithium battery storage.
- Keeps essential and heavy loads (lights, fans, inverter ACs, water pumps) running smoothly during grid power outages and load shedding.
- Also supports MEPCO net-metering to export excess energy once batteries are fully charged.

3. Off-Grid Solar Systems:
- Fully independent solar power with heavy-duty battery banks for remote rural locations, farms, and areas with no grid infrastructure.

4. Agricultural Solar Tubewells:
- High-efficiency solar pumping systems powered by VFD (Variable Frequency Drive) inverters for agricultural tube wells in South Punjab.
- Drastically eliminates diesel fuel costs and grid dependency for farmers.

5. Commercial & Industrial Solar:
- Scalable multi-kilowatt and megawatt setups for factories, textile mills, cold storages, schools, hospitals, and commercial plazas with customized zero-export or net-metering configurations.`,

    title: "Solar Calculator & Cost Savings Estimator",
    content: `Solar Sizing and Savings Calculation Guide for South Punjab:
- South Punjab (Multan, Bahawalpur, D.G. Khan, Rahim Yar Khan) enjoys high solar irradiance with an average of 5.0 to 5.5 Peak Sun Hours daily.
- Each 1 kW of solar panels produces approximately 4 to 4.8 units (kWh) per day, or 120 to 145 units per month.
- Sizing rule of thumb: Divide average monthly units consumed from WAPDA/MEPCO bill by 130 to find required solar capacity in kW.
  * Example: 650 units/month bill / 130 = 5 kW system.
  * Example: 1,300 units/month bill / 130 = 10 kW system.
- Financial ROI: With electricity unit prices ranging from PKR 55 to PKR 65+ per unit, a properly sized solar system typically recovers its full investment in 2.5 to 3.5 years, providing free electricity for the remaining 20+ years of panel life.`,

    content: `MEPCO Net Metering Services by ALP Solar South Punjab:
- Net Metering is a NEPRA-approved mechanism allowing solar owners to export excess electricity generated by their solar systems back into the MEPCO grid.
- Requirements: Three-phase electricity connection, sanctioned load matching or exceeding proposed solar capacity, NEPRA-compliant Tier-1 panels and type-certified inverters (such as AlpSolarr).
- Step-by-Step ALP Solar Turnkey Process:
  1. Site survey and single line diagram (SLD) preparation.
  2. Submitting application to MEPCO Sub-Divisional Office (SDO) / Executive Engineer (XEN).
  3. Load flow study and technical clearance.
  4. Inspection and testing of the solar setup by MEPCO testing division.
  5. Signing 3-year renewable net metering agreement with MEPCO.
  6. Installation of bi-directional Green Meter.
- Total processing time: Typically 3 to 6 weeks. ALP Solar handles 100% of the documentation, liaison, and approvals.`,

    title: "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) - ALP Solar",
    content: `Frequently Asked Questions:
Q: Does ALP Solar operate in my city in South Punjab?
A: Yes! We provide complete solar installations, maintenance, and site surveys in Multan, Bahawalpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, Rahim Yar Khan, Muzaffargarh, Khanewal, Lodhran, Sahiwal, and surrounding districts.

Q: What happens on cloudy or rainy days?
A: Solar panels still generate electricity on overcast days using diffuse sunlight, though at reduced capacity (20-40% of normal). On-grid systems draw required shortfall from MEPCO, while hybrid systems draw from lithium batteries.

Q: What is the warranty on your equipment?
A: Solar panels have a 25-year performance warranty and 12-year product warranty. AlpSolarr inverters carry a 5-year official warranty. Livo Lithium batteries come with a 5 to 10-year warranty. ALP Solar provides 1-year free workmanship and maintenance support.

Q: Can solar run 1.5 ton inverter ACs?
A: Yes! A 5kW system can easily run 1x 1.5 ton inverter AC during daytime. A 10kW system can run 2 to 3 ACs simultaneously along with normal household appliances.

Q: How can I request a quote or site survey?
A: Contact us directly on WhatsApp at 923023333499 or call +92 302 3333499. We offer free initial consultations and site feasibility visits.`,
